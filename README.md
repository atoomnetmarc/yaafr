# What are this?

This is Yaafr, Yet Another AVR Fusebit Rescuer. It is large because of all the ZIF-sockets and does not even feature any mounting holes. It also has two IDC headers for expanding to programming clips or other adapters to rescue non-dip AVR microcontrollers.

It is be able to restore wrongly fused or locked AVR microcontrollers that support high voltage parallel (HVPP) programming or high voltage serial programming (HVSP).

This circuit has been inspired by these projects:

Firmware update 2.11 from the Atmega Fusebit Doctor for the atmega328p has been tested and is working. The [original site](https://files.elektroda.pl/437268,atmega-hvpp-fusebit-doctor_update11.html) does not exist anymore, but [SukkoPera](https://github.com/SukkoPera) has been so kind to archive the remains: https://github.com/SukkoPera/avr-fusebit-doctor/

Firmware from RescueAVR in FBD_MODE works also, but may not contain support for all the chips (such as the AT90S1200).

# Status

This project is working for me, I can rescue all my locked AVRs. See below for what I have tested and validated to be working.

While the schematic was carefully made, the PCB has not been fully tested yet.

I added the possibility to switch on and off AGND and AVCC because in many datasheets in one instance they must be connected and in the next they must not, however leaving the switches always on connected when it does not need to be then the rescues seem to work just fine.

# Errata

## PCB V1.1

- No known erratum, however this pcb version has not been made yet.

## PCB V1.0

- 10.16mm wide 28-pin ZIF socket X3 seems to be unobtanium. Changed for 7.62mm wide 'narrow' 28-pin zif socket in V1.1 pcb.
